An edited (by me!) version of: Frederic Jurie Vittorio Ferrari, Cordelia Schmid, 2007. INRIA horses: a dataset for object class detection.

All of the right-facing horse images (the ‘positives’) were: (i) duplicated (ii) flipped around the vertical axis and (iii) combined with the original, right-facing positive image set. This increases the number of positive images to: 434. There are still 223 negative images. 

The ROIs / descriptive ground-truth files are not included in this revised version of the dataset, as its use for testing did not require the left-facing images to be marked up. As with the original INRIA dataset, the images are all of variable sizes, in colour and in the JPG format.
